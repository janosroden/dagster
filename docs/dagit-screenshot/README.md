# dagit-screenshot

This is a command-line tool for the capture and management of Dagit
screenshots. It is intended to be used to automate the production of
screenshots for the Dagster docs site.

## Installation

This package depends on the Python `selenium` for browser automation, which in
turn depends on a system package `chromedriver`. On macOS, this should install
`dagit-screenshot`:

```
$ brew install chromedriver
$ xattr -d com.apple.quarantine /opt/homebrew/bin/chromedriver  # May not need to run this
$ pip install -e dagit-screenshot
```

## Usage

The core function of `dagit-screenshot` is to generate Dagit screenshot image
files from "screenshot spec" records. A screenshot spec is a JSON/YAML object
with fields specifying parameters that can be used to quasi-automatically
generate a screenshot. Specs live in a "screenshot database", which is just a
directory containing a hierarchy of YAML files, each containing multiple
screenshot specs.

Specs have the following fields. Only the `id` field requires explicit specification for all specs:

- `id`: E.g. `a/b/c.png`, for a screenshot with id "c.png" in `docs/screenshots/a/b.yaml`. The full ID of the spec is formed by joining the (extensionless) path to the defining YAML file with the relative ID. For the special name `index.yaml`, the `index` part is dropped. For example, a spec with `id` field "baz.png" stored in either `screenshots/foo/bar.yaml` or `screenshots/foo/bar/index.yaml` has the full ID `foo/bar/baz.png`. The full ID can be treated as a relative path that, when further qualified with an output root directory, specifies the path to an image file. The default output root is `next/public/images`, so by default the spec with ID `foo/bar/baz.png` corresponds to an image in `next/public/images/foo/bar/baz.png`.
- `route (optional)` Dagit route (i.e. path part of the URL) that will be loaded before taking a screenshot. Defaults to `/`.
- `workspace` (optional): path (relative to the repo root) to a python or workspace YAML file that defines the workspace that should be loaded before attempting screenshot capture. The script will pass the path to `dagit --python-file` or `dagit --workspace` (depending on file type) to load a set of Dagster definitions. This is required for screenshots generated from a local Dagit instance, can should be omitted for screenshots generated from a remote Dagit.
- `base_url (optional)`: Base url (protocol and host) of a Dagit instance to be targeted for a screenshot. Can point to a local or remote host. Defaults to `http://localhost:3000`.
- `vetted (optional)`: boolean indicating whether the current screenshot in the repo was generated using the spec.
- `steps` (optional): manual steps that the person generating the screenshot should carry out before the screenshot is taken.
- `width` (optional): width in pixels of the browser window in which the screenshot will be taken.
- `height` (optional): height in pixels of the browser window in which the screenshot will be taken.

The command line application `dagit-screenshot` is used to manage the specs.
Install `dagit-screenshot` into your environment with `pip install -e
dagit-screenshot`-- this will make the `dagit-screenshot` executable available
on your path. 

To generate the screenshot for a spec, run

```
dagit-screenshot capture <id>`
```

This will attempt to render the specified Dagit view using the browser
automation tool [Selenium](https://www.selenium.dev). If no `steps` are
specified in the target spec, the screenshot will be automatically captured. If
`steps` were specified, after the initial Dagit view has rendered, the user
will be prompted to execute the steps and then press a key to trigger
screenshot capture. Screenshots are written by default to the output path
`next/public/images/<id>`. Note that successfully executing `dagit-screenshot
capture` will overwrite any existing image at the output path.

In addition to the core functionality of capturing screenshots, there are also
`dagit-screenshot audit` and `dagit-screenshot show`. You can learn more about
these commands by running `dagit-screenshot --help`.
